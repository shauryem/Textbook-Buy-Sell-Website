## RECAP (START/STOP/GO):

- STOP: cramming stuff in last minute.
- Continue: We should keep communicating like last week as a team and keep support each other. Also, we should continue to work on our web app and solve the kanban issues.

# Action Item:

- a Goal: we should make a specific plan to make sure we don't need to wait the last minutes to finish the task.
- a change: we should add deadline for each task. Add an extra column in kanban to check deadline. In meeting, we need to discuss if there are any bugs that we can solve together.

## RECAP (START/STOP/GO)

- START: I think we should start trying to get the web app working and figure out how we should distribute the work effectively.
- STOP: I think we should stop leaving decisions about the web app for later.
- GO: I think we should continue learning from tutorials and keeping a positive mindset.

## Action item

- a goal: Learn JavaScript and get a placeholder web app.
- a change: Contact each other more often on slack to keep everyone up to date.
- a measurement: See if we can develop a basic web app that functions properly.

## Retro Assessment

- We used the start/stop/continue retro style where we all put our ideas in the slack and dicussed them once everyone shared.
- The retro went well for situation we had. Retro leaders had to switched on the spot, but regardless we got many great ideas through our discussion. We clarrified what we need to do in the future to be successful.
- The advice I would give to the next retro leader is come in with a game plan on what needs to be discussed so there is no wasted time.
