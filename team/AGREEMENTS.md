# 4/30/2020

Team decided to keep repo closed source, but allow read only access to other CS48 S20 teams on a limited basis,
as determined by course staff when there is an learning opportunity.

# Initial Agreements:

- everyone be nice to each other
- let each other know if we need absent
- We will each try to keep such absences to a minimum
- Those of us that are present will do our best to share with the absent team member(s) what they missed and help them get back up to speed.
- We will all do our best to contribute to the teams success.
