# Team Roles


## Rhys Tracy

I did a majority of database/backend setup. I also helped with setting up the table on the main page and myposts page as part of the frontend/backend connection after the backend was set up. Additionally, I helped with adding functionality and improving features (like adding more search functionality, helping with price sorting, setting up automatic mailing with Nodemailer, etc). Also, I did a lot of bug fixing (when our tests didn't work, when heroku builds failed, etc).

## Haotian Xia

I did Auth0 set up, fixed some database and bootstrap bugs. In addtion, I added some functinality for our font end pages(table, NavBar, submission form, etc.). 

## Shaurye Mahajan

Initially, I was repsonsible for connecting our frontend, backend, and database so that users could post a book for sale via a form and see it on both the home page and my posts page. Later, I factored code into components where I could. I also changed the final look of the frontend with logos, colors, spacing, and toasts. Francie and I researched the google books api for autocomplete features, but decided not to carry on with it.  

## Wilson Phan

I mainly worked on additional features, like adding in a professor category and date function for when sales are posted. I also worked on the form for submitting posts and adding user-friendly features like checking for certain data fields in submitting posts.

## Francie Wei
The majority of my work is optimizing our website to be more user friendly. I soften the book search, reformat the table in the home page and add sorting by date. I also add an alert and confirmation messages after clicking submit or delete, an isbn checker to check if the input ISBN is in the correct format. I spent some time on researching on using google book api, but since we did not figure out how to do the autofill with unknown datasets, we did not build this functionality.
